# Post title in all of it's glory

hello everyone, max the computer fox here, this lil ol file is a baisc blog post
you would make and put inside of your article folder

now those numbers you see on the start of the file is the date of this blog post that will
be render using our buddy python inside to your rss feed, the format is date month year (ddmmyyyy)

now make sure the post title is on the first line using a header one tag in markdown or 
the pound character "#". the Author and Date written here wont really be feed in to your rss feed 
(except the date written on the filename), but if you are willing to fork this repo and make those
things work, you are welcome to do so, that is the beauty of Open Source Software

You could also just not write those there, the Author and Date part of this file would be rendered like
usual markdown anyways, so with that out of the way, enjoy diving trough this hopefully easy to read code
that I took wo write by my self ;3c
