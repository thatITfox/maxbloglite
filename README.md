# Welcome to Max The Computer Fox's blogging server

![Welcome](static/welcome.png)

just a basic flask app for now, just need something to host my posts freely lol

this code takes pride in being mostly human written, no fancy AI tools like copilot, cursor, or
any of the latest fancy AI tools you could find out there ( well I do take snippets from chatgpt ),
you can push in suggestions and PR's trough github, tho I may move this repository to my own 
personal server or inside my homelab, but for now all contributions can be done inside of here.

feel free to fork this code for your own use, all free under the GPL 3.0 license

all documentation can be found under DOCS.md
